### File naming convention
Besides the usuall server.R and ui.R, the app uses prefixes "text_ for files with text input that are entered into the code using includeMarkdown() and "dataIO_"" for data input and and output files doing data-import, export and wrangling. Temporary files not running and other shite are prefixed "temporary_".
