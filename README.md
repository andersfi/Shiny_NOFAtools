## NOFA tools 
Shiny app with collectons of tools to interact with the NOFA database. Build on ShinyDashboard framework. Primary working objective is to provide a toolbox for data preparation and pre-fligth-checks. App hosted at https://shiny.vm.ntnu.no/users/andersfi/NOFAtools/    

### File naming convention
Besides the usuall server.R and ui.R, the app uses the text prefix (e.g.'text'_'appname'_'tabName') for files with text input that are entered into the code using e.g includeMarkdown() and 'dataIO_' prefix for data input and and output files doing data-import, export and wrangling. Temporary files not running and other shite are prefixed "temporary_". 

Still under developement...
